							NextGen Code Company was founded in Lubbock Texas by a group of experienced freelance coders.
							After years of building relationships within the tech community, the founding team decided to combine
							their talents and join forces to create NextGen. NextGen’s team has now expanded and grown into an
							efficient and highly productive workforce that can provide solutions most businesses can only dream up.
							With a heavy focus on technology related consulting the team doesn’t just understand the code, they
							understand the problems that they are solving.
							NextGen has four core founding members. These members all come from different backgrounds and
							educations which makes the team exceptionally powerful. By combining all their different styles of
							thinking, they are able to unfold the most powerful solutions possible. Acting as a think tank, the team is
							able to develop uniquely creative solutions inspiring NextGen to reach outside of the box. Aided by the
							unbreakable team chemistry and unmatched trust, the team is incredibly capable of providing long-term
							solutions for a better world.
							NextGen has taken on several complex projects for their partners, ranging from graphic design,
							websites, web/mobile apps, UI/UX design, internal business solutions and many more. Combining
							technology and experience, NextGen believes any dream a partner has can be turned it into reality with
							the right knowledge and code. The founding members have managed several of their own businesses
							with success in the past, but they created NextGen to share those discovered solutions from past
							experiences with all current and future partners. NextGen has the educational and professional
							qualifications to critically analyze your “wants” and “whys” to produce the absolute best product that
							you desire.
							NextGen labels success from producing products like no other. They pride themselves on leaving no
							stone unturned and perfecting the small overlooked details to overwhelm their partners with pure
							excellence. NextGen labels success from the relationships they build with their partners. NextGen aims
							to have their partners walk away from a presentation knowing that they have chosen the right trusted
							team to help them build their dream into a reality. NextGen labels success by the value their partners
							receive once the services or products are integrated in their business. Producing and deploying the right
							product or service properly to their partners for maximum return is NextGen’s goal.
